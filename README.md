🎬About CineMood🎬

CineMood is a free web application that utilizes a Machine Learning model to recommend a movie to the user based on their current location's date and time. This application collects weather information using the OpenWeatherAPI and returns a weather code and time. This code and time is then fed to a Machine Learning model and returns a list of genres. Next, this list is fed into an algorithm, which returns a list of 20 movies that best fit the given genres. Finally, a movie is randomly selected from this list and is recommended to the user. The user can freely swap through this list in case their first pick isn't to their liking.
